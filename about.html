		<p>Hi everyone! My name is Maggie and I am a senior studying electrical
		engineering and computer science at UW-Madison. In my free time, I sing in
		the choir at St. Paul's, do crafts such as drawing and crocheting, read, and 
		try different hobbies. I took this class to learn more about website development
		and because I was interested in the intersection of concepts I learned in sociology
		with topics more related to my majors. My favorite 'tech' thing currently
		is my biomedical instrumentation course because we apply many of the 
		electrical engineering concepts I have learned in various courses to
		medical technology and get to build medical devices.</p>
