		<p>Hi everyone! My name is Maggie and I am a senior studying electrical
		engineering and computer science at UW-Madison. In my free time, I sing in
		the choir at St. Paul's, do crafts such as drawing and crocheting, read, and 
		try different hobbies. I took this class to learn more about website development
		and because I was interested in the intersection of concepts I learned in sociology
		with topics more related to my majors. My favorite 'tech' thing currently
		is my biomedical instrumentation course because we apply many of the 
		electrical engineering concepts I have learned in various courses to
		medical technology and get to build medical devices.</p>

		<p>Hi y'all, my name is Qamryn! I am a senior studying Information Science with a 
		certificate Leadership. I am on the Wisconsin Cheerleading team so that takes 
		up the majority of my time outside of school. I'm also in Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority,
		Inc. and currently serve as the President of the National Pan-Hellenic Council on 
		campus. I took this class because I am aware of the issue of the lack of 
		representation or the misrepresentation of diverse human groups in computer 
		sciences, but I wanted to learn more about how those issues are becoming more 
		important today, how to work to overcome that, aside from the obvious answer of 
		just increasing diversity in this field, and I want to confront my own assumptions 
		as well. My favorite 'tech' thing right now is learning about Big Data and AI â€“ it's 
		ethicality, it's environmental impact, it's incorporation into our daily lives, 
		non-tecnology industries, and how it is changing human thinking and behavior.</p>
