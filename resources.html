	<p>Intersectionality is the combination of various traits such as race, age, class,
	and gender that make up an individual and the bias a person receives based on these traits. The heart
	of intersectionality is that each individual has a unique experience because everyone has a
	unique set of traits and circumstances.<p>

	<p>Implicit bias is unconcious prejudice held by an individual in regards to a specific group which may influence
	attitudes and actions towards that group. We both took implicit bias tests and were surprised
	by our results. Both of us questioned the validity of the tests as we both struggled more with
	the second task once the buttons switched.</p>
